# Akatsuki's PP System
This repository is dedicated to our PP system, including both vanilla & relax.

We use [oppai](https://github.com/Francesco149/oppai-ng), an open-source difficulty & pp calculator for osu! written in C89, with some slight modifications for relax.

## Usage
This is intended to be used on linux - I personally have it setup in VSCode w/ WSL so I can use the debugger, but command line should work fine.
* Create a folder called `maps`; here  you can put any maps you'd like the suite to calculate.
* Configure the basic configuration in suite.cpp to your liking.
* Compile suite and you should be able to go!

### Contributing
As a disclaimer, we are not interested in small subjective tinkering with values - if you're looking to contribute, you should have some decent experience in computer science/mathematics and an understanding of osu! (and possibly relax), if you're looking for a quick 2 line nerf, chances are we have already internally discussed values and come to our own conclusions on them - you're welcome to contribute but remember this is run on a live server, we're looking for quality. :P
